## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Jin discovers a forgotten artifact (a tool, a letter, a photograph) on the old rubber estate that changes his understanding of the land's history.
- Write a chapter from the perspective of Ramesh the mechanic, detailing the last day in his workshop as he packs his tools and memories.
- Compose a tense dialogue where Jin must explain his 'sentimental' defense of the *parit* to a purely profit-driven, international investor.
- Write a flashback scene featuring Jin's father, showing the moment he decided to fight for (or compromise on) a piece of land, revealing the origin of Jin's internal conflict.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Kuala Lumpur tracking the locations in the novel (Meranti Tower, Uncle Hock's estate, the *mamak* stall, Ramesh's workshop) and layer it with historical land-use data and current development projects.
- Create a 'Memory vs. Modernization' text analyzer that scans a chapter and highlights passages related to tradition/history in one color and progress/development in another, visualizing Jin's internal dialogue.
